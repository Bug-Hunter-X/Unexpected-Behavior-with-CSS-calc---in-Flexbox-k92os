# Unexpected Behavior with CSS calc() in Flexbox

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue related to the `calc()` function in CSS when used within a flexbox container.  The example shows how `calc(100% - 10px)` might not behave as intuitively expected, potentially leading to unexpected layout issues.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS, while `bugSolution.css` offers a corrected approach.

This issue highlights the importance of understanding how `calc()` interacts with different CSS layout models.
