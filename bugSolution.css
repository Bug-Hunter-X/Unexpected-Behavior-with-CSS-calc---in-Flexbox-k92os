To avoid this issue, ensure that the `calc()` function is used correctly. In the case of flexbox, consider using flex-basis or other flexbox properties to control the item's size instead of relying solely on `calc()` to manage margins or padding. In this specific example, setting a width using `calc()` within a flexbox item might not always produce accurate results.  It's better to control the size using `flex-basis` or `width` combined with `margin` outside the flexbox structure.
